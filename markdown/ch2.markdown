# Quantile normalization with NumPy and SciPy

Our use case is using gene expression data to predict mortality in skin cancer patients. We will reproduce a simplified version of [Figures 5A and 5B](http://www.cell.com/action/showImagesData?pii=S0092-8674%2815%2900634-0) from this  [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.044), which comes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project.

The code we will work to understand is an implementation of [*quantile normalization*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile_normalization), a technique that ensures measurements fit a specific distribution.
This requires a strong assumption: if the data are not distributed according to a bell curve, we just make it fit!
But it turns out to be simple and useful in many cases where the specific distribution doesn't matter, but the relative changes of values within a population are important.
For example, Bolstad and colleagues [showed](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/19.2.185) that it performs admirably in recovering known expression levels in microarray data.

Using NumPy indexing tricks and the `scipy.stats.mstats.rankdata` function, quantile normalization in Python is fast, efficient, and elegant.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

def quantile_norm(X):
    """Normalize the columns of X to each have the same distribution.

    Given an expression matrix (microarray data, read counts, etc) of M genes
    by N samples, quantile normalization ensures all samples have the same
    spread of data (by construction).

    The input data is log-transformed, then the data across each row are
    averaged to obtain an average column. Each column quantile is replaced
    with the corresponding quantile of the average column.
    The data is then transformed back to counts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : 2D array of float, shape (M, N)
        The input data, with M rows (genes/features) and N columns (samples).

    Returns
    -------
    Xn : 2D array of float, shape (M, N)
        The normalized data.
    """
    # log-transform the data
    logX = np.log2(X + 1)

    # compute the quantiles
    log_quantiles = np.mean(np.sort(logX, axis=0), axis=1)

    # compute the column-wise ranks. Each observation is replaced with its
    # rank in that column: the smallest observation is replaced by 0, the
    # second-smallest by 1, ..., and the largest by M, the number of rows.
    ranks = stats.mstats.rankdata(X, axis=0).astype(int) - 1

    # index the quantiles for each rank with the ranks matrix
    logXn = log_quantiles[ranks]

    # convert the data back to counts (casting to int is optional)
    Xn = np.round(2**logXn - 1).astype(int)
    return(Xn)
```

We'll unpack that example throughout the chapter, but for now note that it illustrates many of the things that make NumPy powerful (you will remember the first three of these moves from chapter 1):

- Arrays can be one-dimensional, like lists, but they can also be two-dimensional, like matrices, and higher-dimensional still. This allows them to represent many different kinds of numerical data. In our case, we are representing a 2D matrix.
- Arrays allow the expression of many numerical operations at once. In the first line of the function, we take $\log(x + 1)$ for every value in the array.
- Arrays can be operated on along *axes*. In the second line, we sort the data along each column just by specifying an `axis` parameter to `np.sort`. We then take the mean along each row by specifying a *different* `axis`.
- Arrays underpin the scientific Python ecosystem. The `scipy.stats.mstats.rankdata` function operates not on Python lists, but on NumPy arrays. This is true of many scientific libraries in Python.
- Arrays support many kinds of data manipulation through *fancy indexing*: `logXn = log_quantiles[ranks]`. This is possibly the trickiest part of NumPy, but also the most useful. We will explore it further in the text that follows.

### Get the data

As in Chapter 1, we will be working with the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) skin cancer RNAseq data set.
Our goal is to predict mortality in skin cancer patients using their RNA expression data.
By the end of this chapter we will have reproduced a simplified version of [Figures 5A and 5B](http://www.cell.com/action/showImagesData?pii=S0092-8674%2815%2900634-0) of a [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.044) from the TCGA consortium.

As in Chapter 1, first we will use Pandas to make our job of reading in the data much easier.
First we will read in our counts data as a pandas table.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Import TCGA melanoma data
filename = 'data/counts.txt'
with open(filename, 'rt') as f:
    data_table = pd.read_csv(f, index_col=0) # Parse file with pandas

print(data_table.iloc[:5, :5])
```

Looking at the first 5 rows and columns of `data_table` you we can see that the
columns are the samples and the rows are the genes.
Now let's put our counts in an ndarray.

```python
# 2D ndarray containing expression counts for each gene in each individual
counts = np.asarray(data_table, dtype=int)
```

Now, let's get a feel for our counts data by plotting the distribution of counts for each individual.
We will use a Gaussian kernel to smooth out bumps in our data so we can get a
better idea of the overall shape.

```python
# Make plots appear inline, set custom plotting style
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('style/elegant.mplstyle')
```

```python
def plot_col_density(data, xlabel=None):
    """For each column (individual) produce a density plot over all rows (genes).

    data : 2d nparray
    xlabel : x axis label
    """

    density_per_col = [stats.kde.gaussian_kde(col) for col in data.T] # Use Gaussian smoothing to estimate the density
    x = np.linspace(np.min(data), np.max(data), 100)

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    for density in density_per_col:
        ax.plot(x, density(x))
    ax.set_xlabel(xlabel)

# Before normalization
log_counts = np.log(counts + 1)
plot_col_density(log_counts, xlabel="Log count distribution for each individual")
```

We can see that while the distributions of counts are broadly similar,
some individuals have flatter distributions and a few are pushed right over to the left.
When doing our analysis of the counts data later in this chapter, we will be assuming
that changes in gene expression are due to biological differences between our samples.
But a major distribution shift like this suggests that the differences are technical.
That is, the changes are likely due to differences in the way we processed each sample,
rather than due to biological variation.
So we will try to normalize out these global differences between individuals.

To do this, we will be performing quantile normalization.
The idea is that we assume all our samples should have a similar distribution,
so any differences in the shape are due to some technical variation.
We can fix this by forcing all the samples to have the same distribution.
More formally, given an expression matrix (microarray data, read counts, etc) of
ngenes by nsamples, quantile normalization ensures all samples have the same spread
of data (by construction). It involves:

- (optionally) log-transforming the data
- sorting all the data points column-wise
- averaging the rows and
- replacing each column quantile with the quantile of the average column.

With NumPy and SciPy, this can be done easily and efficiently.

Let's assume we've read in the input matrix as X:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

def quantile_norm(X):
    """Normalize the columns of X to each have the same distribution.

    Given an expression matrix (microarray data, read counts, etc) of M genes
    by N samples, quantile normalization ensures all samples have the same
    spread of data (by construction).

    The input data is log-transformed, then the data across each row are
    averaged to obtain an average column. Each column quantile is replaced
    with the corresponding quantile of the average column.
    The data is then transformed back to counts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : 2D array of float, shape (M, N)
        The input data, with M rows (genes/features) and N columns (samples).

    Returns
    -------
    Xn : 2D array of float, shape (M, N)
        The normalized data.
    """
    # log-transform the data
    logX = np.log2(X + 1)

    # compute the quantiles
    log_quantiles = np.mean(np.sort(logX, axis=0), axis=1)

    # compute the column-wise ranks
    ranks = stats.mstats.rankdata(X, axis=0).astype(int) - 1
    # alternative: ranks = np.argsort(np.argsort(X, axis=0), axis=0)

    # index the quantiles for each rank with the ranks matrix
    logXn = log_quantiles[ranks]

    # convert the data back to counts (casting to int is optional)
    Xn = np.round(2**logXn - 1).astype(int)
    return(Xn)
```

Now, let's see what our distributions look like after quantile normalization.

```python
# After normalization
log_quant_norm_counts = np.log(quantile_norm(counts)+1)

plot_col_density(log_quant_norm_counts, xlabel="Log count distribution for each individual")
```

As you might expect, the distributions now look virtually identical!

Now that we have normalized our counts, we can start using our gene expression data to predict mortality

## Biclustering the counts data

Now that the data are normalized, we can cluster the genes (rows) and samples (columns) of the expression matrix.
Clustering the rows tells us which genes' expression values are linked, which is an indication that they work together in the process being studied.
Clustering the samples tells us which samples have similar gene expression profiles, which may indicate similar characteristics of the samples on other scales.

Because clustering can be an expensive operation, we will limit our analysis to the 1,500 genes that are most variable, since these will account for most of the correlation signal in either dimension.

```python
def most_variable_rows(data, *, n=1500):
    """Subset data to the n most variable rows

    In this case, we want the n most variable genes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : 2D array of float
        The data to be subset
    n : int, optional
        Number of rows to return.
    """
    # compute variance along the columns axis
    rowvar = np.var(data, axis=1)
    # Get sorted indices (ascending order), take the last n
    sort_indices = np.argsort(rowvar)[-n:]
    # use as index for data
    variable_data = data[sort_indices, :]
    return variable_data
```

Next, we need a function to *bicluster* the data.
This means clustering along both the rows (to find out with genes are working together) and the columns (to find out which samples are similar).

Normally, you would use a sophisticated clustering algorithm from the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) library for this.
In our case, we want to use hierarchical clustering for simplicity and ease of display.
The SciPy library happens to have a perfectly good hierarchical clustering module, though it requires a bit of wrangling to get your head around its interface.

As a reminder, hierarchical clustering is a method to group observations using sequential merging of clusters:
initially, every observation is its own cluster.
Then, the two nearest clusters are repeatedly merged, and then the next two,
and so on, until every observation is in a single cluster.
This sequence of merges forms a *merge tree*.
By cutting the tree at a specific height, we can get a finer or coarser clustering of observations.

The `linkage` function in `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` performs a hierarchical clustering of the rows of a matrix, using a particular metric (for example, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or others) and a particular linkage method, the distance between two clusters (for example, the average distance between all the observations in a pair of clusters).

It returns the merge tree as a "linkage matrix", which contains each merge operation along with the distance computed for the merge and the number of observations in the resulting cluster. From the `linkage` documentation:

> A cluster with an index less than $n$ corresponds to one of
> the $n$ original observations. The distance between
> clusters `Z[i, 0]` and `Z[i, 1]` is given by `Z[i, 2]`. The
> fourth value `Z[i, 3]` represents the number of original
> observations in the newly formed cluster.

Whew! So that's a lot of information, but let's dive right in and hopefully you'll get the hang of it rather quickly.
First, we define a function, `bicluster`, that clusters both the rows *and* the columns of a matrix:

```python
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage


def bicluster(data, linkage_method='average', distance_metric='correlation'):
    """Cluster the rows and the columns of a matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : 2D ndarray
        The input data to bicluster.
    linkage_method : string, optional
        Method to be passed to `linkage`.
    distance_metric : string, optional
        Distance metric to use for clustering. See the documentation
        for ``scipy.spatial.distance.pdist`` for valid metrics.

    Returns
    -------
    y_rows : linkage matrix
        The clustering of the rows of the input data.
    y_cols : linkage matrix
        The clustering of the cols of the input data.
    """
    y_rows = linkage(data, method=linkage_method, metric=distance_metric)
    y_cols = linkage(data.T, method=linkage_method, metric=distance_metric)
    return y_rows, y_cols
```

Simple: we just call `linkage` for the input matrix and also for the transpose of that matrix, in which columns become rows and rows become columns.

# Visualizing clusters

Next, we define a function to visualize the output of that clustering.
We are going to rearrange the rows and columns of the input data so that similar rows are together and similar columns are together.
And we are additionally going to show the merge tree for both rows and columns, displaying which observations belong together for each.
The merge trees are presented as dendrograms, with the branch-lengths indicating how similar the observations are to each other (shorter = more similar).

As a word of warning, there is a fair bit of hard-coding of parameters going on here.
This is difficult to avoid for plotting, where design is often a matter of eyeballing to find the correct proportions.

```python
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, leaves_list


def clear_spines(axes):
    for loc in ['left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom']:
        axes.spines[loc].set_visible(False)
    axes.set_xticks([])
    axes.set_yticks([])


def plot_bicluster(data, row_linkage, col_linkage,
                   row_nclusters=10, col_nclusters=3):
    """Perform a biclustering, plot a heatmap with dendrograms on each axis.

    """
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))

    # Compute and plot row-wise dendrogram
    # `add_axes` takes a "rectangle" input to add a subplot to a figure.
    # The figure is considered to have side-length 1 on each side, and its

    ax1 = fig.add_axes([0.09, 0.1, 0.2, 0.6])

    # tree by looking at the corresponding distance annotation in the linkage

    # See notes above for explanation of parameters to `add_axes`
    ax2 = fig.add_axes([0.3, 0.71, 0.6, 0.2])
    threshold_c = (col_linkage[-col_nclusters, 2] +
                   col_linkage[-col_nclusters+1, 2]) / 2

    # Sort data by the dendrogram leaves
    idx_rows = leaves_list(row_linkage)
    data = data[idx_rows, :]
    idx_cols = leaves_list(col_linkage)
    data = data[:, idx_cols]

    im = ax.matshow(data, aspect='auto', origin='lower', cmap='YlGnBu_r')
    clear_spines(ax)

    # Axis labels

    # Plot legend
    axcolor = fig.add_axes([0.91, 0.1, 0.02, 0.6])
    plt.colorbar(im, cax=axcolor)

    # display the plot
    plt.show()
```

Now we apply these functions to our normalized counts matrix to display row and column clusterings.

```python
counts_log = np.log(counts + 1)
counts_var = most_variable_rows(counts_log, n=1500)
yr, yc = bicluster(counts_var)
plot_bicluster(counts_var, yr, yc)
```

## Predicting survival

We can see that the sample data naturally falls into at least 2 clusters.
Are these clusters meaningful?
To answer this, we can access the patient data, available from the [data repository](https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/skcm_2015/) for the paper.
After some preprocessing, we get the [patients table]() (TODO: LINK TO FINAL PATIENTS TABLE), which contains survival information for each patient.
We can then match these to the counts clusters, and understand whether the patients' gene expression can predict differences in their pathology.

```python
patients = pd.read_csv('data/patients.csv', index_col=0)
patients.head()
```

For each patient (the rows) we have:

- UV­ signature: Ultraviolet light tends to cause specific DNA mutations.
By looking for this mutation signature they can infer that UV light likely caused the mutation(s) that lead to cancer in these patients.
- original­ clusters: In the paper, the patients were clustered using gene expression data.
These clusters were classified according to the types of genes that typified that cluster.
The main clusters were "immune" (n = 168; 51%), "keratin" (n = 102; 31%), and "MITF-low" (n = 59; 18%).
- melanoma­ survival­ time: Number of days that the patient survived.
- melanoma­ dead: 1 if the patient died of melanoma, 0 if they are alive or died of something else.

Now we need to draw *survival curves* for each group of patients defined by the clustering.
This is a plot of the fraction of a population that remains alive over a period of time.
Note that some data is *right-censored*, which means that in some cases, we don't actually know when the patient died, or the patient might have died of causes unrelated to the melanoma.
We count these patients as "alive" for the duration of the survival curve, but more sophisticated analyses might try to estimate their likely time of death.

To obtain a survival curve from survival times, we create a step function that decreases by $1/n$ at each step, where $n$ is the number of patients in the group.
We then match that function against the non-censored survival times.

```python
def survival_distribution_function(lifetimes, right_censored=None):
    """Return the survival distribution function of a set of lifetimes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lifetimes : array of float or int
        The observed lifetimes of a population. These must be non-
        -negative.
    right_censored : array of bool, same shape as `lifetimes`
        A value of `True` here indicates that this lifetime was not
        observed. Values of `np.nan` in `lifetimes` are also considered
        to be right-censored.

    Returns
    -------
    sorted_lifetimes : array of float
        The
    sdf : array of float
        Values starting at 1 and progressively decreasing, one level
        for each observation in `lifetimes`.

    Examples
    --------

    In this example, of a population of four, two die at time 1, a
    third dies at time 2, and a final individual dies at an unknown
    time. (Hence, ``np.nan``.)

    >>> lifetimes = np.array([2, 1, 1, np.nan])
    >>> survival_distribution_function(lifetimes)
    (array([ 0.,  1.,  1.,  2.]), array([ 1.  ,  0.75,  0.5 ,  0.25]))
    """
    n_obs = len(lifetimes)
    rc = np.isnan(lifetimes)
    if right_censored is not None:
        rc |= right_censored
    observed = lifetimes[~rc]
    xs = np.concatenate( ([0], np.sort(observed)) )
    ys = np.linspace(1, 0, n_obs + 1)
    ys = ys[:len(xs)]
    return xs, ys
```

Now that we can easily obtain survival curves from the survival data, we can plot them.
We write a function that groups the survival times by cluster identity and plots each group as a different line:

```python
def plot_cluster_survival_curves(clusters, sample_names, patients,
                                 censor=True):
    """Plot the survival data from a set of sample clusters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    clusters : array of int or categorical pd.Series
        The cluster identity of each sample, encoded as a simple int
        or as a pandas categorical variable.
    sample_names : list of string
        The name corresponding to each sample. Must be the same length
        as `clusters`.
    patients : pandas.DataFrame
        The DataFrame containing survival information for each patient.
        The indices of this DataFrame must correspond to the
        `sample_names`. Samples not represented in this list will be
        ignored.
    censor : bool, optional
        If `True`, use `patients['melanoma-dead']` to right-censor the
        survival data.
    """
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    if type(clusters) == np.ndarray:
        cluster_ids = np.unique(clusters)
        cluster_names = ['cluster {}'.format(i) for i in cluster_ids]
    elif type(clusters) == pd.Series:
        cluster_ids = clusters.cat.categories
        cluster_names = list(cluster_ids)
    n_clusters = len(cluster_ids)
    for c in cluster_ids:
        clust_samples = np.flatnonzero(clusters == c)
        # discard patients not present in survival data
        clust_samples = [sample_names[i] for i in clust_samples
                         if sample_names[i] in patients.index]
        patient_cluster = patients.loc[clust_samples]
        survival_times = np.array(patient_cluster['melanoma-survival-time'])
        if censor:
            censored = ~np.array(patient_cluster['melanoma-dead']).astype(bool)
        else:
            censored = None
        stimes, sfracs = survival_distribution_function(survival_times,
                                                        censored)
        ax.plot(stimes / 365, sfracs)

    ax.set_xlabel('survival time (years)')
    ax.set_ylabel('fraction alive')
    ax.legend(cluster_names)
```

Now we can use the `fcluster` function to obtain cluster identities for the samples (columns of the counts data), and plot each survival curve separately.
The `fcluster` function takes a linkage matrix, as returned by `linkage`, and a threshold, and returns cluster identities.
It's difficult to know a-priori what the threshold should be, but we can obtain the appropriate threshold for a fixed number of clusters by checking the distances in the linkage matrix.

```python
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import fcluster
n_clusters = 3
threshold_distance = (yc[-n_clusters, 2] + yc[-n_clusters+1, 2]) / 2
clusters = fcluster(yc, threshold_distance, 'distance')

plot_cluster_survival_curves(clusters, data_table.columns, patients)
```

The clustering of gene expression profiles has identified a higher-risk subtype of melanoma, which constitutes the majority of patients.
This is indeed only the latest study to show such a result, with others identifying subtypes of leukemia (blood cancer), gut cancer, and more.
Although the above clustering technique is quite fragile, there are other ways to explore this dataset and similar ones that are more robust.

<!-- exercise begin -->
**Exercise:** Do our clusters do a better job of predicting survival than the original clusters in the paper? What about UV signature?

Plot survival curves using the original­ clusters and UV signature columns of the patient data. How do they compare to our clusters?
<!-- exercise end -->

<!-- exercise begin -->

**Exercise:** We leave you the exercise of implementing the approach described in the paper:

1. Take bootstrap samples (random choice with replacement) of the genes used to cluster the samples;
2. For each sample, produce a hierarchical clustering;
3. In a `(n_samples, n_samples)`-shaped matrix, store the number of times a sample pair appears together in a bootstrapped clustering.
4. Perform a hierarchical clustering on the resulting matrix.

This identifies groups of samples that frequently occur together in clusterings, regardless of the genes chosen.
Thus, these samples can be considered to robustly cluster together.

*Hint: use `np.random.choice` with `replacement=True` to create bootstrap samples of row indices.*
