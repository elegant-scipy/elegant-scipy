# Networks of Image Regions with ndimage

**Code by Vighnesh Birodkar.**  
**Nominated by Juan Nunez-Iglesias.**

This chapter gets a special mention because it inspired the whole book.
Vighnesh Birodkar wrote this code snippet as an undergraduate while participating in
Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2014.
When I saw this bit of code, it blew me away, and over a year later, I still
haven't seen anything like it.
For the purposes of this book, it touches on many aspects of scientific Python.
By the time you're done with this chapter, you should be able to process arrays
of *any* dimension, rather than thinking of them only as 1D lists or 2D tables.
More than that, you'll understand the basics of image filtering and network
processing.

You probably know that digital images are made up of *pixels*. These are
the light signal *sampled on a regular grid*. When computing
on images, we often deal with objects much larger than individual pixels.
In a landscape, the sky, earth, trees, and rocks each span many
pixels. A common structure to represent these is the Region Adjacency Graph,
or RAG. Its *nodes* hold properties of each region in the image, and its
*links* hold the spatial relationships between the regions. Two nodes are
linked whenever their corresponding regions touch each other in the input
image.

Building such a structure could be a complicated
affair, and even more difficult
when images are not two-dimensional but 3D and even 4D, as is
common in microscopy, materials science, and climatology, among others. But
here we will show you how to produce a RAG in a few lines of code using
NetworkX (a Python library to analyze graphs and networks), and
a filter from SciPy's N-dimensional image processing submodule, `ndimage`.

```python
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
from scipy import ndimage as nd

def add_edge_filter(values, graph):
    center = values[len(values) // 2]
    for neighbor in values:
        if neighbor != center and not graph.has_edge(center, neighbor):
            graph.add_edge(center, neighbor)
    return 0.0


def build_rag(labels, image):
    g = nx.Graph()
    footprint = ndi.generate_binary_structure(labels.ndim, connectivity=1)
    _ = ndi.generic_filter(labels, add_edge_filter, footprint=footprint,
                           mode='nearest', extra_arguments=(g,))
    return g
```

There are a few things going on here: images being represented as numpy arrays,
*filtering* of these images using `scipy.ndimage`, and building of the image
regions into a graph (network) using the NetworkX library. We'll go over these
in turn.

# Images are numpy arrays

In the previous chapter, we saw that numpy arrays can efficiently represent
tabular data, and are a convenient way to perform computations on it.
It turns out that arrays are equally adept at representing images.

Here's how to create an image of white noise using just numpy, and display it
with matplotlib. First, we import the necessary packages, and use the `matplotlib
inline` IPython magic to make our images appear below the code:

```python
%matplotlib inline

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('style/elegant.mplstyle')

import numpy as np
import matplotlib as mpl
from matplotlib import cm  # colormap module
```

Finally, "make some noise" and display it as an image:

```python
random_image = np.random.rand(500, 500)
plt.imshow(random_image);
```

This `imshow` function displays a numpy array as an image. The converse is also true: an image
can be considered as a numpy array. For this example we use the scikit-image
library, a collection of image processing tools built on top of NumPy and SciPy.

Here is a PNG image from the scikit-image repository. It is a black and white
(sometimes called "grayscale") picture of some ancient Roman coins from
Pompeii, obtained from the Brooklyn Museum [^coins-source]:

![Coins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scikit-image/scikit-
image/v0.10.1/skimage/data/coins.png)

Here is the coin image loaded with scikit-image:

```python
from skimage import io
url_coins = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/v0.10.1/skimage/data/coins.png'
coins = io.imread(url_coins)
print("Type:", type(coins), "Shape:", coins.shape, "Data type:", coins.dtype)
plt.imshow(coins);
```

A grayscale image can be represented as a *2-dimensional array*, with each array
element containing the grayscale intensity at that position. So, **an image is
just a numpy array**.

Color images are a *3-dimensional* array, where the first two dimensions
represent the spatial positions of the image, while the final dimension represents
color channels, typically the three primary additive colors of red, green, and blue.
To show what we can do with these dimensions, let's play with this photo of astronaut Eileen Collins:

```python
url_astronaut = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/master/skimage/data/astronaut.png'
astro = io.imread(url_astronaut)
print("Type:", type(astro), "Shape:", astro.shape, "Data type:", astro.dtype)
plt.imshow(astro);
```

This image is *just numpy arrays*. Adding a green square to the image is easy
once you realize this, using simple numpy slicing:

```python
astro_sq = np.copy(astro)
astro_sq[50:100, 50:100] = [0, 255, 0]  # red, green, blue
plt.imshow(astro_sq);
```

You can also use a boolean *mask*, an array of `True` or `False` values.
We saw these in Chapter 2 as a way to select rows of a table. In this case, we
can use an array of the same shape as the image to select pixels:

```python
astro_sq = np.copy(astro)
sq_mask = np.zeros(astro.shape[:2], bool)
sq_mask[50:100, 50:100] = True
astro_sq[sq_mask] = [0, 255, 0]
plt.imshow(astro_sq);
```

<!-- exercise begin -->

**Exercise:** We just saw how to select a square and paint it green. Can you
extend that to other shapes and colors? Create a function to draw a blue grid
onto a color image, and apply it to the `astronaut` image of Eileen Collins
(above). Your function should take
two parameters: the input image, and the grid spacing.
Use the following template to help you get started.

```python
def overlay_grid(image, spacing=128):
    """Return an image with a grid overlay, using the provided spacing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : array, shape (M, N, 3)
        The input image.
    spacing : int
        The spacing between the grid lines.

    Returns
    -------
    image_gridded : array, shape (M, N, 3)
        The original image with a blue grid superimposed.
    """
    image_gridded = image.copy()
    pass  # replace this line with your code...
    return image_gridded

# plt.imshow(overlay_grid(astro, 128));  # ... and uncomment this line to test your function
```

<!-- solution begin -->

**Solution:** We can use numpy slicing to select the rows of the grid, set them
to blue, and then select the columns, and set them to blue as well:

```python
def overlay_grid(image, spacing=128):
    """Return an image with a grid overlay, using the provided spacing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : array, shape (M, N, 3)
        The input image.
    spacing : int
        The spacing between the grid lines.

    Returns
    -------
    image_gridded : array, shape (M, N, 3)
        The original image with a blue grid superimposed.
    """
    image_gridded = image.copy()
    image_gridded[spacing:-1:spacing, :] = [0, 0, 255]
    image_gridded[:, spacing:-1:spacing] = [0, 0, 255]
    return image_gridded

plt.imshow(overlay_grid(astro, 128))
```

Note that we used `-1` to mean the last value of the axis, as is standard in
Python indexing. You can omit this value, but the meaning is slightly
different. Without it (i.e. `spacing::spacing`), you go all the way to the end
of the array, including the final row/column. When you use it as the stop
index, you prevent the final row from being selected. In the case of a grid
overlay, this is probably the desired behavior.

# Filters in signal processing

Filtering is one of the most fundamental and common operations in image
processing. You can filter an image to remove noise, to enhance features, or to
detect edges between objects in the image.

To understand filters, it's easiest to start with a 1D signal, instead of an image. For
example, you might measure the light arriving at your end of a fiber-optic cable.
If you *sample* the signal every millisecond (ms) for 100ms, you end up with an
array of length 100. Suppose that after 30ms the light signal is turned on, and
30ms later, it is switched off. You end up with a signal like this:

```python
sig = np.zeros(100, np.float) #
sig[30:60] = 1  # signal = 1 during the period 30-60ms because light is observed
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(sig);
ax.set_ylim(-0.1, 1.1);
```

To find *when* the light is turned on, you can *delay* it by 1ms, then
*subtract* the original from the delayed signal. This way, when the signal is
unchanged from one millisecond to the next, the subtraction will give zero,
but when the signal *increases*, you will get a positive signal.

When the signal *decreases*, we will get a negative signal. If we are
only interested in pinpointing the time when the light was turned on, we can
*clip* the difference signal, so that any negative values are converted to 0.

```python
sigdelta = sig[1:]  # sigdelta[0] equals sig[1], and so on
sigdiff = sigdelta - sig[:-1]
sigon = np.clip(sigdiff, 0, np.inf)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(sigon)
ax.set_ylim(-0.1, 1.1)
print('Signal on at:', 1 + np.flatnonzero(sigon)[0], 'ms')
```

(Here we have used NumPy's `flatnonzero` function to get the first index where
the `sigon` array is not equal to 0.)

It turns out that this can be accomplished by an signal processing operation
called *convolution*. At every point of the signal, we compute the dot-product
between the values surrounding it and a *kernel* or *filter*, which is a
predetermined vector of values. Depending on the kernel, then, the convolution
shows a different feature of the signal.

Now, think of what happens when the kernel is (1, 0, -1), the difference
filter, for a signal `s`. At any position `i`, the convolution result is
`1*s[i+1] + 0*s[i] - 1*s[i-1]`, that is, `s[i+1] - s[i-1]`.
Thus, when adjacent values are identical, the convolution gives 0, but when
`s[i+1] > s[i-1]` (the signal is increasing), it gives a positive value, and,
conversely, when `s[i+1] < s[i-1]`, it gives a negative value. You can think
of this as an estimate of the derivative of the input function.

In general, the formula for convolution is:
$s'(t) = \sum_{j=t-\tau}^{t}{s(j)f(t-j)}$
where $s$ is the signal, $s'$ is the filtered signal, $f$ is the filter, and
$\tau$ is the length of the filter.

In scipy, you can use the `scipy.ndimage.convolve` to work on this.

```python
diff = np.array([1, 0, -1])
from scipy import ndimage as ndi
dsig = ndi.convolve(sig, diff)
plt.plot(dsig);
```

Signals are usually *noisy* though, not perfect as above:

```python
sig = sig + np.random.normal(0, 0.3, size=sig.shape)
plt.plot(sig);
```

The plain difference filter can amplify that noise:

```python
plt.plot(ndi.convolve(sig, diff));
```

In such cases, you can add smoothing to the filter. The most common form of
smoothing is *Gaussian* smoothing, which takes the weighted average of
neighboring points in the signal using the
[Gaussian function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function). We can
write a function to make a Gaussian smoothing kernel as follows:

```python
def gaussian_kernel(size, sigma):
    """Make a 1D Gaussian kernel of the specified size and standard deviation.

    The size should be an odd number and at least ~6 times greater than sigma
    to ensure sufficient coverage.
    """
    positions = np.arange(size) - size // 2
    kernel_raw = np.exp(-positions**2 / (2 * sigma**2))
    kernel_normalized = kernel_raw / np.sum(kernel_raw)
    return kernel_normalized
```

A really nice feature feature of convolution is that it's *associative*,
meaning if you want to find the derivative of the smoothed signal, you can
equivalently convolve the signal with the smoothed difference filter! This can
save a lot of computation time, because you can smooth just the filter, which
is usually much smaller than the data.

```python
smooth_diff = ndi.convolve(gaussian_kernel(25, 3), diff)
plt.plot(smooth_diff)
```

This smoothed difference filter looks for an edge in the central position,
but also for that difference to continue. This continuation happens in the case
of a true
edge, but not in "spurious" edges caused by noise. Check out the result:

```python
sdsig = ndi.convolve(sig, smooth_diff)
plt.plot(sdsig);
```

Although it still looks wobbly, the *signal-to-noise ratio* (SNR),
is much greater in this version than when using the simple difference filter.

(Note: this operation is called filtering because, in physical electrical
circuits, many of these operations are implemented by hardware that
lets certain kinds of current through, but not others; these components
are called filters. For example, a common filter that removes high-frequency
voltage fluctuations from a current is called a *low-pass filter*.)

# Filtering images (2D filters)

Now that you've seen filtering in 1D, I hope you'll find it straightforward
to extend these concepts to 2D. Here's a 2D difference filter finding the
edges in the coins image:

```python
coins = coins.astype(float) / 255  # prevents overflow errors
diff2d = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, -1], [0, -1, 0]])
coins_edges = ndi.convolve(coins, diff2d)
io.imshow(coins_edges);
```

The principle is the same as the 1D filter: at every point in the image, place the
filter, compute the dot-product of the filter's values with the image values, and
place the result at the same location in the output image. And, as with the 1D
difference filter, when the filter is placed on a location with little variation, the
dot-product cancels out to zero, whereas, placed on a location where the
image brightness is changing, the values multiplied by 1 will be different from
those multiplied by -1, and the filter's output will be a positive or negative
value (depending on whether the image is brighter towards the bottom-right
or top-left at that point).

Just as with the 1D filter, you can get more sophisticated and smooth out
noise right within the filter. The *Sobel* filter is designed to do just that.
It comes in horizontal and vertical varieties, to find edges with that
orientation in the data.
Let's start with the horizontal filter first.
To find a horizontal edge in a picture, you might try the following filter:

```python
# column vector (vertical) to find horizontal edges
hdiff = np.array([[1], [0], [-1]])
```

However, as we saw with 1D filters, this will result in a noisy estimate of the
edges in the image. But rather than using Gaussian smoothing, which can cause
blurry edges, the Sobel filter uses the property that edges in images tend to
be continuous: a picture of the ocean, for example, will contain a horizontal
edge along an entire line, not just at specific points of the image. So the
Sobel filter smooths the vertical filter horizontally: it looks for a strong
edge at the central position that is corroborated by the adjacent positions:

```python
hsobel = np.array([[ 1,  2,  1],
                   [ 0,  0,  0],
                   [-1, -2, -1]])
```

The vertical Sobel filter is simply the transpose of the horizontal:

```python
vsobel = hsobel.T
```

We can then find the horizontal and vertical edges in the coins image:

```python
# Some custom x-axis labelling to make our plots easier to read
def reduce_xaxis_labels(ax, factor):
    """Show only every ith label to prevent crowding on x-axis
        e.g. factor = 2 would plot every second x-axis label,
        starting at the first.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ax : matplotlib plot axis to be adjusted
    factor : int, factor to reduce the number of x-axis labels by
    """
    plt.setp(ax.xaxis.get_ticklabels(), visible=False)
    for label in ax.xaxis.get_ticklabels()[::factor]:
        label.set_visible(True)
```

```python
coins_h = ndi.convolve(coins, hsobel)
coins_v = ndi.convolve(coins, vsobel)

fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2)
axes[0].imshow(coins_h, cmap=plt.cm.RdBu)
axes[1].imshow(coins_v, cmap=plt.cm.RdBu)
for ax in axes:
    reduce_xaxis_labels(ax, 2)

```

And finally, just like the Pythagorean theorem, you can argue that the edge
magnitude in *any* direction is equal to the square root of the sum of squares
of the horizontal and vertical components:

```python
coins_sobel = np.sqrt(coins_h**2 + coins_v**2)
plt.imshow(coins_sobel, cmap=plt.cm.viridis);
```

# Generic filters

In addition to dot-products, implemented by `ndi.convolve`, SciPy lets you
define a filter that is an *arbitrary function* of the points in a neighborhood,
implemented in `ndi.generic_filter`. This can let you express arbitrarily
complex filters.

For example, suppose an image represents median house values in a county,
with a 100m x 100m resolution. The local council decides to tax house sales as
$10,000 plus 5% of the 90th percentile of house prices in a 1km radius. (So,
selling a house in an expensive neighborhood costs more.) With
`generic_filter`, we can produce the map of the tax rate everywhere in the map:

```python
from skimage import morphology
def tax(prices):
    return 10000 + 0.05 * np.percentile(prices, 90)
house_price_map = (0.5 + np.random.rand(100, 100)) * 1e6
footprint = morphology.disk(radius=10)
tax_rate_map = ndi.generic_filter(house_price_map, tax, footprint=footprint)
plt.imshow(tax_rate_map)
plt.colorbar()
```

Now lets step back for a moment and put what we've learnt so far together to tackle a few exercises.

<!-- exercise begin -->

**Exercise:** Conway's Game of Life.

Suggested by Nicolas Rougier.

Conway's [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a
seemingly simple construct in which "cells" on a regular square grid live or die
according to the cells in their immediate surroundings. At every timestep, we
determine the state of position (i, j) according to its previous state and that
of its 8 neighbors (above, below, left, right, and diagonals):

- a live cell with only one live neighbor or none dies.
- a live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on for another generation.
- a live cell with four or more live neighbors dies, as if from overpopulation.
- a dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive, as if by
  reproduction.

Although the rules sound like a contrived math problem, they in fact give rise
to incredible patterns, starting with gliders (small patterns of live cells
that slowly move in each generation) and glider guns (stationary patterns that
sprout off gliders), all the way up to prime number generator machines (see,
for example,
[this page](http://www.njohnston.ca/2009/08/generating-sequences-of-primes-in-conways-game-of-life/)),
and even
[simulating Game of Life itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8)!

Can you implement the Game of Life using `ndi.generic_filter`?

<!-- solution begin -->

**Solution:**

Code by: Nicolas Rougier (@rougier)

This is the game of life (cellular automata) in 10 lines of python with numpy.
The code is available from http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/numpy.100/ (last question).
(code explanations is available from http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/numpy/numpy.html)

**Exercise:** Use `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` to fit the tail of the
in-degree survival function to a power-law,
$f(d) \sim d^{-\gamma}, d > d_0$,
for $d_0 = 10$ (the red line in Figure 6B of the paper), and modify the plot
to include that line.

**Exercise:** Sobel gradient magnitude.

Above, we saw how we can combine the output of two different filters, the
horizontal Sobel filter, and the vertical one. Can you write a function that
does this in a single pass using `ndi.generic_filter`?

# Graphs and the NetworkX library

To introduce you to graphs, we will reproduce some results from the paper
["Structural properties of the *Caenorhabditis elegans* neuronal network"](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001066), by Varshney *et al*, 2011.
Note that in this context the term "graph" is synonymous with "network", but not with "plot".
Mathematicians and computer scientists invented slightly different words to discuss these:
graph = network, vertex = node, and edge = link.
As most people do, we will be using these terms interchangeably.

You might be slightly more familiar with the network terminology: a network consists of
*nodes* and *links* between the nodes. Equivalently, a graph consists of *vertices* and
*edges* between the vertices. In NetworkX, you have `Graph` objects consisting of
`nodes` and `edges` between the nodes. Oh well.

Graphs are a natural representation for a bewildering variety of data. Pages on the world
wide web, for example, can comprise nodes, while links between those pages can be,
well, links. Or, in so-called *transcription networks*, nodes represent genes and edges
connect genes that have a direct influence on each other's expression.

In our example, we will represent neurons in the nematode worm's nervous system as
nodes, and place an edge between two nodes when a neuron makes a synapse with
another. (*Synapses* are the chemical connections through which neurons
communicate.) The worm is an awesome example of neural connectivity analysis
because every worm (of this species) has the same number of neurons (302), and the
connections between them are all known. This has resulted in the fantastic Openworm
project [^openworm], which I encourage you to follow.

You can download the neuronal dataset in Excel format (yuck) from the WormAtlas
database at [http://www.wormatlas.org/neuronalwiring.html#Connectivitydata](http://www.wormatlas.org/neuronalwiring.html#Connectivitydata).
The direct link to the data is:
[http://www.wormatlas.org/images/NeuronConnect.xls](http://www.wormatlas.org/images/NeuronConnect.xls)
Let's start by getting a list of rows out of the file. An elegant pattern from
Tony Yu [^file-url] enables us to open a remote URL as a local file.
It uses a
[context manager](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager)
to download a remote file to a local temporary file.
(Your operating system provides Python with a place to put temporary files.)

The funny `@something` syntax might be new to you.
This is a Python [decorator](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/), a
function that modifies another function.
We won't go over decorators just yet, as they are a side point here.
In Chapter 8, we will discuss a particular decorator in more detail.

We then use the `xlrd` library to read the contents of the Excel file into a
connectivity matrix.

```python
import os
import xlrd  # Excel-reading library in Python

from urllib.request import urlopen  # getting files from the web, Py3

import tempfile
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def url2filename(url):
    base_filename, ext = os.path.splitext(url)
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, suffix=ext) as f:
        remote = urlopen(url)
        f.write(remote.read())
    try:
        yield f.name
    finally:
        os.remove(f.name)

connectome_url = "http://www.wormatlas.org/images/NeuronConnect.xls"

with url2filename(connectome_url) as fin:
    sheet = xlrd.open_workbook(fin).sheet_by_index(0)
    conn = [sheet.row_values(i) for i in range(1, sheet.nrows)]
```

`conn` now contains a list of connections of the form:

[Neuron1, Neuron2, connection type, strength]

We are only going to examine the connectome of chemical synapses, so we filter
out other synapse types as follows:

```python
conn_edges = [(n1, n2, {'weight': s}) for n1, n2, t, s in conn
              if t.startswith('S')]
```

(Look at the WormAtlas page for a description of the different connection types.)

We use `weight` in a dictionary above because it is a special keyword for
edge properties in NetworkX. We then build the graph using NetworkX's
`DiGraph` class:

```python
import networkx as nx
wormbrain = nx.DiGraph()
wormbrain.add_edges_from(conn_edges)
```

We can now examine some of the properties of this network. One of the
first things researchers ask about directed networks is which nodes are
the most critical to information flow within it. Nodes with high
*betweenness centrality* are those that belong to the shortest path between
many different pairs of nodes. Think of a rail network: certain stations will
connect to many lines, so that you will be forced to change lines there
for many different trips. They are the ones with high betweenness
centrality.

With NetworkX, we can find similarly important neurons with ease. In the
NetworkX API documentation [^nxdoc], under "centrality", the docstring
for `betweenness_centrality` [^bwcdoc] specifies a function that takes a
graph as input and returns a dictionary mapping node IDs to betweenness
centrality values (floating point values).

```python
centrality = nx.betweenness_centrality(wormbrain)
```

Now we can find the neurons with highest centrality using the Python built-in
function `sorted`:

```python
central = sorted(centrality, key=centrality.__getitem__, reverse=True)
print(central[:5])
```

This returns the neurons AVAR, AVAL, PVCR, PVT, and PVCL, which have been
implicated in how the worm responds to prodding: the AVA neurons link
the worm's front touch receptors (among others) to neurons responsible
for backward motion, while the PVC neurons link the rear touch receptors to
forward motion.

These neurons' high centrality feels like a bit of an artifact of their placement
controlling a large number of motor neurons. Yes, they are in many routes
from sensory neurons to motor neurons. But all of the motor neurons do essentially
the same thing, as hinted at by their generic names, VA 1-12. If we were to collapse
them into one, the high centrality of the "command" neurons AVA R and L, and
PVC R and L, might vanish. Returning to the rail lines example, suppose trains
between Penn Station in New York City and Washington DC's Union
Station could end up at one of 12 different platforms, *and we counted each of
those as a separate train line*. The betweenness centrality of Penn Station
would be inflated because from it you could get to Union Station platform 1,
platform 2, etc. That's not necessarily very interesting.

Varshney *et al* study the properties of a *strongly connected component*
of 237 neurons, out of a total of 279. In graphs, a
*connected component* is a set of nodes that are reachable by some path
through all the links. The connectome is a *directed* graph, meaning the
edges *point* from one node to the other, rather than merely connecting
them. In this case, a strongly connected component is one where all nodes
are reachable from each other by traversing links *in the correct direction*.
So A $\rightarrow$ B $\rightarrow$ C is not strongly connected, because there is no way to get to
A from B or C. However, A $\rightarrow$ B $\rightarrow$ C $\rightarrow$ A *is* strongly connected.

In a neuronal circuit, you can think of the strongly connected component
as the "brain" of the circuit, where the processing happens, while nodes
upstream of it are inputs, and nodes downstream are outputs.

Starting with any given neuron in the chain, you could retrace the signal's steps and figure out just how long ago the lightning struck. Unless, that is, the chain is a loop. In that case, the information encoding the lightning bolt just spins in circles, endlessly. It bears no connection to the time at which the lightning actually occurred. It becomes, as McCulloch put it, "an idea wrenched out of time." In other words, a memory.

NetworkX makes straightforward work out of getting the largest strongly
connected component from our `wormbrain` network:

```python
sccs = nx.strongly_connected_component_subgraphs(wormbrain)
giantscc = max(sccs, key=len)
print('The largest strongly connected component has %i nodes,' %
      giantscc.number_of_nodes(), 'out of %i total.' %
      wormbrain.number_of_nodes())
```

As noted in the paper, the size of this component is *smaller* than
expected by chance, demonstrating that the network is segregated into
input, central, and output layers.

Now we reproduce figure 6B from the paper, the survival function of the
in-degree distribution. First, compute the relevant quantities:

```python
in_degrees = list(wormbrain.in_degree().values())
in_deg_distrib = np.bincount(in_degrees)
avg_in_degree = np.mean(in_degrees)
cumfreq = np.cumsum(in_deg_distrib) / np.sum(in_deg_distrib)
survival = 1 - cumfreq
```

Then, plot using Matplotlib:

```python
plt.loglog(np.arange(1, len(survival) + 1), survival)
plt.xlabel('in-degree distribution')
plt.ylabel('fraction of neurons with higher in-degree distribution')
plt.scatter(avg_in_degree, 0.0022, marker='v')
plt.text(avg_in_degree - 0.5, 0.003, 'mean=%.2f' % avg_in_degree)
plt.ylim(0.002, 1.0)
plt.show()
```

**Exercise:** Use `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` to fit the tail of the
in-degree survival function to a power-law,
$f(d) \sim d^{-\gamma}, d > d_0$,
for $d_0 = 10$ (the red line in Figure 6B of the paper), and modify the plot
to include that line.

# Region adjacency graphs

I hope that the previous section gave you an idea of the power of graphs as a scientific
abstraction, and also how Python makes it easy to manipulate and analyse
them. Now we will study a special kind of graph, the region adjacency
graph, or RAG. This is a representation of an image that is useful for *segmentation*,
the division of images into meaningful regions (or *segments*). If you've seen
Terminator 2, you've seen segmentation:

![Terminator vision](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scikit-image/skimage-tutorials/master/2014-scipy/images/terminator-vision.png)

Segmentation is one of those problems that humans do trivially, all the time,
without thinking, whereas computers have a really hard time of it. To
understand this difficulty, look at this image:

![Face (Eileen Collins)](http://i.imgur.com/ky5qwIS.png)

While you see a face, a computer only sees a bunch of numbers:

(Yes, your visual system is tuned enough to find faces that it sees the
face even in this blob of numbers! But I hope you get my point. Also, check
out the "Faces In Things" Tumblr.)

So the challenge is to make sense of those numbers, and where the
boundaries lie that divide the different parts of the image. A popular
approach is to find small regions (called superpixels) that
you're *sure* belong in the same segment, and then merge those according
to some more sophisticated rule.

As a simple example, suppose you want to segment out the tiger in this
picture, from the Berkeley Segmentation DataSet (BSDS) [^bsds-tiger]:

![BSDS-108073 tiger](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/BSDS300/html/images/plain/normal/color/108073.jpg)

A clustering algorithm, simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) [^slic], can give
us a decent starting point. It is available in the scikit-image library.

```python
url = 'http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/BSDS300/html/images/plain/normal/color/108073.jpg'
tiger = io.imread(url)
from skimage import segmentation
seg = segmentation.slic(tiger, n_segments=30, compactness=40.0,
                        enforce_connectivity=True, sigma=3)
```

Scikit-image also has a function to *display* segmentations, which we use to
visualize the result of SLIC:

```python
from skimage import color
io.imshow(color.label2rgb(seg, tiger))
```

This shows that the tiger has been split in three parts, with the rest of the image
in the remaining segments.

A region adjacency graph (RAG) is a graph in which every node represents one
of the above regions, and an edge connects two nodes when they touch. For a
taste of what it looks like before we build one, we'll use the `show_rag` function
from scikit-image — indeed, the library that contains this chapter's code snippet!

```python
from skimage.future import graph
g = graph.rag_mean_color(tiger, seg)
graph.show_rag(seg, g, tiger)
```

Here, you can see the nodes corresponding to each segment, and the edges
between adjacent segments. These are colored with the YlGnBu (yellow-green-blue)
colormap from matplotlib, according to the difference in color between the
two nodes.

The figure also shows the magic of thinking of segmentations as graphs: you can
see that edges between nodes within the tiger and those outside of it are darker
(higher-valued) than edges within the same object. Thus, if we can cut the
graph along those edges, we will get our segmentation! (Yes, I have chosen an easy
example for color-based segmentation, but the same principles hold true for
graphs with more complicated pairwise relationships!)

# Elegant ndimage

All the pieces are in place: you know about numpy arrays, image filtering,
generic filters, graphs, and region adjacency graphs. Let's build one to pluck
the tiger out of that picture!

The obvious approach is to use two nested for-loops to iterate over every pixel
of the image, look at the neighboring pixels, and checking for different labels:

```python
import networkx as nx
def build_rag(labels, image):
    g = nx.Graph()
    nrows, ncols = labels.shape
    for row in range(nrows):
        for col in range(ncols):
            current_label = labels[row, col]
            if not current_label in g:
                g.add_node(current_label)
                g.node[current_label]['total color'] = np.zeros(3, dtype=np.float)
                g.node[current_label]['pixel count'] = 0
            if row < nrows - 1 and labels[row + 1, col] != current_label:
                g.add_edge(current_label, labels[row + 1, col])
            if col < ncols - 1 and labels[row, col + 1] != current_label:
                g.add_edge(current_label, labels[row, col + 1])
            g.node[current_label]['total color'] += image[row, col]
            g.node[current_label]['pixel count'] += 1
    return g
```

This works, but if you want to segment a 3D image, you'll have to write a
different version:

```python
import networkx as nx
def build_rag_3d(labels, image):
    g = nx.Graph()
    nplns, nrows, ncols = labels.shape
    for pln in range(nplns):
        for row in range(nrows):
            for col in range(ncols):
                current_label = labels[pln, row, col]
                if not current_label in g:
                    g.add_node(current_label)
                    g.node[current_label]['total color'] = np.zeros(3, dtype=np.float)
                    g.node[current_label]['pixel count'] = 0
                if pln < nplns - 1 and labels[pln + 1, row, col] != current_label:
                    g.add_edge(current_label, labels[pln + 1, row, col])
                if row < nrows - 1 and labels[pln, row + 1, col] != current_label:
                    g.add_edge(current_label, labels[pln, row + 1, col])
                if col < ncols - 1 and labels[pln, row, col + 1] != current_label:
                    g.add_edge(current_label, labels[pln, row, col + 1])
                g.node[current_label]['total color'] += image[pln, row, col]
                g.node[current_label]['pixel count'] += 1
    return g
```

Both of these are pretty ugly and unwieldy, too. And difficult to extend:
if we want to count diagonally neighboring pixels as adjacent (that is,
[row, col] is "adjacent to" [row + 1, col + 1]), the code becomes even
messier. And if we want to analyze 3D video, we need yet another
dimension, and another level of nesting. It's a mess!

Enter Vighnesh's insight: SciPy's `generic_filter` function already does
this iteration for us! We used it above to compute an arbitrarily
complicated function on the neighborhood of every element of a numpy
array. Only now we don't want a filtered image out of the function: we
want a graph. It turns out that `generic_filter` lets you pass additional
arguments to the filter function, and we can use that to build the graph:

```python
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
from scipy import ndimage as nd

def add_edge_filter(values, graph):
    center = values[len(values) // 2]
    for neighbor in values:
        if neighbor != center and not graph.has_edge(center, neighbor):
            graph.add_edge(center, neighbor)
    # float return value is unused but needed by `generic_filter`
    return 0.0

def build_rag(labels, image):
    g = nx.Graph()
    footprint = ndi.generate_binary_structure(labels.ndim, connectivity=1)
    _ = ndi.generic_filter(labels, add_edge_filter, footprint=footprint,
                           mode='nearest', extra_arguments=(g,))
    for n in g:
        g.node[n]['total color'] = np.zeros(3, np.double)
        g.node[n]['pixel count'] = 0
    for index in np.ndindex(labels.shape):
        n = labels[index]
        g.node[n]['total color'] += image[index]
        g.node[n]['pixel count'] += 1
    return g
```

There's a few things to notice here:

- we return "0.0" from the filter function because `generic_filter` requires
  the filter function to return a float. However, we will ignore the filter
  output, and only use it for its "side effect" of adding edges to the graph.
- the loops are not nested several levels deep. This makes the code more
  compact, easier to take in in one go.
- the code works identically for 1D, 2D, 3D, or even 8D images!
- if we want to add support for diagonal connectivity, we just need to
  change the `connectivity` parameter to `ndi.generate_binary_structure`
- `ndi.generic_filter` iterates over array elements *with their neighbors*;
  use `numpy.ndindex` to simply iterate over array indices.

Overall, I think this is just a brilliant piece of code.

# Putting it all together: mean color segmentation

Now, we can use it to segment the tiger in the image above:

```python
g = build_rag(seg, tiger)
for n in g:
    node = g.node[n]
    node['mean'] = node['total color'] / node['pixel count']
for u, v in g.edges_iter():
    d = g.node[u]['mean'] - g.node[v]['mean']
    g[u][v]['weight'] = np.linalg.norm(d)
```

Each edge holds the difference between the average color of each segment.
We can now threshold the graph:

```python
def threshold_graph(g, t):
    to_remove = ((u, v) for (u, v, d) in g.edges(data=True)
                 if d['weight'] > t)
    g.remove_edges_from(to_remove)
threshold_graph(g, 80)
```

Finally, we use the numpy index-with-an-array trick we learned in chapter 2:

```python
map_array = np.zeros(np.max(seg) + 1, int)
for i, segment in enumerate(nx.connected_components(g)):
    for initial in segment:
        map_array[int(initial)] = i
segmented = map_array[seg]
plt.imshow(color.label2rgb(segmented, tiger));
```

Oops! Looks like the cat lost its tail!

Still, we think that's a nice demonstration of the capabilities of RAGs...
And the beauty with which SciPy and NetworkX make it feasible!

Many of these functions are available in the scikit-image library. If you
