**Solution:** Let's look at the start of the docstring for `curve_fit`:

%TODO - possible to embed docstring directly, e.g. with include directive?
```
Use non-linear least squares to fit a function, f, to data.

Assumes ``ydata = f(xdata, *params) + eps``

Parameters
----------
f : callable
    The model function, f(x, ...).  It must take the independent
    variable as the first argument and the parameters to fit as
    separate remaining arguments.
xdata : An M-length sequence or an (k,M)-shaped array
    for functions with k predictors.
    The independent variable where the data is measured.
ydata : M-length sequence
    The dependent data --- nominally f(xdata, ...)
```

It looks like we just need to provide a function that takes in a data point,
and some parameters, and returns the predicted value. In our case, we want the
cumulative remaining frequency, $f(d)$ to be proportional to $d^{-\gamma}$.
That means we need $f(d) = \alpha d^{-gamma}$:

```python
def fraction_higher(degree, alpha, gamma):
    return alpha * degree ** (-gamma)
```

Then, we need our x and y data to fit, *for $d > 10$*:

```python
x = 1 + np.arange(len(survival))
valid = x > 10
x = x[valid]
y = survival[valid]
```

We can now use `curve_fit` to obtain fit parameters:

```python
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

alpha_fit, gamma_fit = curve_fit(fraction_higher, x, y)[0]
```

Let's plot the results to see how we did:

```python
y_fit = fraction_higher(x, alpha_fit, gamma_fit)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.loglog(np.arange(1, len(survival) + 1), survival)
ax.set_xlabel('in-degree distribution')
ax.set_ylabel('fraction of neurons with higher in-degree distribution')
ax.scatter(avg_in_degree, 0.0022, marker='v')
ax.text(avg_in_degree - 0.5, 0.003, 'mean=%.2f' % avg_in_degree)
ax.set_ylim(0.002, 1.0)
ax.loglog(x, y_fit, c='red');
```

Voil√†! A full Figure 6B, fit and all!
