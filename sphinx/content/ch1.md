# Elegant NumPy: The Foundation of Scientific Python

> [NumPy] is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room.
> You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your
> television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church...
> when you pay your taxes.

This chapter touches on some statistical functions in [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org), but more than that, it focuses on exploring the NumPy array, a data structure that underlies almost all numerical scientific computation in Python.
